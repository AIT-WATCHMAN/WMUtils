Watchman Collection
===================

This repository is an organized dumping ground for watchman related code which
should include useful tools (such as watchmakers and sibyl), related analysis
scripts, macro files, and anything else that does not belong directly in
rat-pac. Larger tools (again like watchmakers and sibyl) can live within their
own home repositories, but should be linked here as a git submodule.
